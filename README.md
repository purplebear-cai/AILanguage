# AI Language Learning UI for Japanese  

This project is a **Streamlit-based UI** designed to help users **learn Japanese** through interactive conversations in various real-world scenarios. The app allows users to review past conversations, generate new ones with an LLM, explore vocabulary and grammar, and listen to native pronunciation.  

## Features  

### 1. Scenario-Based Conversations  
- Users can **select a scenario** (e.g., restaurant, airport, shopping, etc.) to practice relevant conversations.  
- The UI generates a **5-turn dialogue** in Japanese based on the selected scenario.  

### 2. Conversation Review & Generation  
- Users can **upload previous conversations** to review.  
- Alternatively, an **LLM generates new dialogues** dynamically.  

### 3. Multi-Language Display  
- Conversations are displayed in:  
  - **Kanji (æ¼¢å­—)**  
  - **Romaji (Romanized Japanese)**  
  - **English translation**  

### 4. Vocabulary Learning  
- Extracts **important words** from the conversation.  
- Provides **example sentences** for each word to reinforce learning.  

### 5. Grammar Breakdown  
- Identifies key **grammar structures** from the conversation.  
- Offers **detailed explanations** with extra example sentences.  

### 6. Save & Load Conversations  
- Users can **save conversations, vocabulary, and grammar explanations** in a local folder.  
- Supports **reloading saved files** for review.  

### 7. Native-Like Pronunciation  
- The app includes **text-to-speech (TTS)** functionality to pronounce Japanese sentences like a native speaker.
